# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project 0 was based on me and a little bit of the hobbies I enjoy.I included five different HTML pages. My "Home", "About Me", "Hobbies", "Education", and "Contact Me" pages. I did include an "UL" in my nav for all pages. I had one stylesheet containing my CSS and SCSS coding with the CSS MAP inluded. I also added more than five CSS properties and selectors. I added an #ID selector to my text in my "Education" page and added a .class selector in my "About Me" page. I included a media query for desktop responsiveness in my CSS file.I used Bootstrap 4 on my "hobbies" page that inluded three colomns containg a picture each. (Soccer, Football, and Basketball.) MY SCSS Variables, Nesting, and Inheritance are all labeled with comments on the SCSS file.
