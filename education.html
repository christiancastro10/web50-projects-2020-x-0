        <p id="text"> When I first graduated from high school all I wanted to do was play soccer so I decided to take an "easy" career path to automotive system technology. After a couple of semesters in that field I realized that was something I was not passionate about and wanted to change careers.I decided that I would choose something where I would be able to work smarter, not harder. So that is what ultimately landed me with the idea of becoming a web devloper. At first it was a bit unsettling because I had the most minimal idea about computers and not to mention coding itself. I am currently attending GTCC in Greensboro, N.C. Time has made things easier and I can not wait for what the future holds. After getting my associates I plan on slowly working to my bachelors as well. </p>
